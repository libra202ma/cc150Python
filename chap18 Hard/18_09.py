"""
Numbers are randomly generated and passed to a method. Write a
program to find and maintain the median value as new values are
generated.

Use two linked list, one for the larger ones and one for the smaller
ones. They are both sorted. The larger list is sorted increasingly and
the smaller list is sorted decreasingly. When new number came in,
compare it with median. If greater than median, put it in larger list,
otherwise put into smaller list. Then make sure the lists are almost
equal size.


Use two heap.
