- talk about education (? not for sure. It has been some time)
- talk about programming experience.
- talk about virtual functions in C++. (Cause I mentioned I have
  experience in C++ in the last step.)
- how to reverse a string?
- design core data structures for a TODO list app. The app will have
  multiple TODO lists or entry, and each list will contain multiple
  lists or entries.
