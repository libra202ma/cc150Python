Explain the difference between templates in C++ and generics in Java.

Java generics is rooted in an idea of "type erasure", thus sometimes called "syntactic sugar".

In C++, templates are essentially a glorified macro set, with the compiler creating a new copy of the template code for each type.

So differences are,

- C++ templates can use primitive types, like 'int'. Java cannot and must instead use `Integer`.
-  In Java, you can restrict the templates's type parameters to be of a certain type.
- In C++, the type parameter can be instantiated, whereas Java does not support thos.
- In Java, the type parameter cannot be used for static methods and variables, since these would be shared between MyClass<Foo> and MyClass<Bar>. In C++, these classes are different, so the type parameter can be used for static methods and variables.
- In Java, all instances of MyClass, regardless of their type parameters, are the same type. The type parameters are erased at runtime. In C++, instances with different type parameters are different types.

Although Java generics and C++ templates look the same in many ways, they are very different.
