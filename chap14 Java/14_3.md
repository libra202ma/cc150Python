What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?

final: for variable of primitive, it means this variable would not be changed after initialization. For reference type, it means this references cannot be changed to point to other object.  For method, it means this method would not be overrided. For class, it means this class would not be subclassed.

finally: used in try-catch-finally block.

finalize: used to customize actions when garbage collection happening.
