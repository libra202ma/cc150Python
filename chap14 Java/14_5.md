Explain what object reflection is in Java and why it is useful?

Object Reflection is a feature in Java which provides a way to get reflective information about Java classes and objects, and perform operations such as,

- Getting information about the methods and fields present inside the class at runtime.
- Creating a new instance of a class.
- Getting and setting the object fields directly by getting field reference, regardless of what the access modifier is.

Useful for

- It helps in observing or manipulating the runtime behavior of applications.
- It can help in debugging or testing programs, as we have direct access to methods, constructors, and fields.
- We can call methods by name when we don't know the method in advance. For example, we may let the user pass in a class name, parameters for the constructor, and a method name. We can then use this information to create an object and call a method. Doing these operations without reflection would require a complex series of if-statements, if it's possible at all.
