We have the following method used in a chess game, `boolean
canMoveTo(int x, int y)`. This method is part of the Piece class and
returns whether or not the piece can move to position (x, y). Explain
how you would test this method.

Questions to discuss: what's the size of board? Will it change?

- normal cases.
- extreme cases: on the edge or corner of the board.
- null and "illegal" inputs: negative position.
- strange inputs.
