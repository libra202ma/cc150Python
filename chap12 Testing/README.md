How to approach,

- Are we doing Black Box Testing or White Box Testing?
- Who will use? And why?
- What are the use cases?
- What are the bounds of use?
- What are the stress conditions / failure conditions?
- What are the test cases? How would you perform the testing?


Type of test cases,

- normal case
- extremes
- nulls and "illegal" input
- strange input
