You are given the source to an application which crashes when it is
run. After running it ten times in a debugger, you find it never
crashes in the same place. The application is single threaded, adn
uses only the C standard library. What programming errors could be
causing this crash? How would you test each one?

Possible reasons:

Unsane usage of pointers or memory overflow. Manual check of the code is one possible way, as well as automated checker like valgrind.
