"""
You have a stack of n boxes, with widths w_i, height h_i, and
depth d_i. The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top
of noe another if each box in the stack is strictly larger than the
box above it in width, height and depth. Implement a method to build
the tallest stack possible, where the height of a stack is the sum of
the heights of each box.

- recursion. Insert the last box to see if higher height could be
achieved. (?)
