A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes
with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as
soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00pm every
evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color, but they do
not know their own (nor is everyone allowed to tell
them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes,
although they do know that at least one person does. How many days
will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?

- days = number of blue-eyed people.  If number of blue-eyed people c
== 1, then the person look around and found no other blue-eyed people
and c > 0, then he must realized that he is the one, and he will take
first day's flight. If c == 2, all men will realize the c >= 2 in the
second day. One of the blue-eyed people can only find one blue-eyed
people. So they will take second day's flight. And so on so forth.
