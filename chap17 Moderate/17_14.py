Oh, no! YOu have just completed a lengthy document when you have
an unfortunate Find/Replace mishap. You have accidentally removed all
spaces, punctuation, and capitalization in the document. A sentence
like "I reset the computer. It still didn't boot!" would become
"iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot". You figure taht you can add back
in the punctation and capitalization later, once you get the
individual words properly separated. Most of the words will be in a
dictionary, but some string like proper names, will not. Given a
dictionary (a list of words), design an algorithm to find the optimal
way of "unconcatenating" a sequence of words. In this case, "optimal"
is defined to be the parsing which minimize the number of unrecognized
sequences of characters.

For example, the string "jesslookedjustlikeimherbrother" would be
optimally parsed as "JESS looked just like TIM here brother". This
passing has seven unrecognized characters, which we have capitalized
for clarity.

NO CLUE.
